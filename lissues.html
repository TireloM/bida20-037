                    <h1>New York: Local Life and Transport</h1>
                    <p>New Yorkers are notorious for being unfriendly and sometimes even mean. Despite this popular stereotype, most people in New York are actually quite friendly and obliging, perhaps even more so than one might expect in a city of its size. It is not uncommon for passers-by to stop and offer their help if someone looks lost, or for neighbors to be on friendly, even familiar, terms.

                        However, friendliness shouldn’t always be mistaken for friendship. While New Yorkers are certainly open and welcoming and will try their best to make you feel at home, relations tend to be somewhat superficial until you really get to know someone well. It is only polite to take an interest in your new acquaintances’ lives, but too personal questions and revelations should be avoided at first.</p>

                    <h1>Jobs and Anti-Business Feeling</h1>
                    <p>Businesses create the engine which makes the city run. From the smallest to the largest, they oil the wheels of New York, creating jobs and providing services. The city courts disaster, especially in moments like these, when many of its politicians cast business as the enemy of the people. Local candidates refuse real estate money as a demonstration of virtue. Politicians exult in the defeat of initiatives like rezoning Industry City or bringing Amazon AMZN +0.5% to Long Island City as if they weren’t depriving their communities of both jobs and infusions of capital. With so many industries, hospitality and dining at the top of the list, being forced to let workers go, the city needs all the jobs it can create.</p>

                    <h1>Quality of Life</h1>
                    <p>Harassment of pedestrians, panhandling, homelessness, petty crime, all have made a gradual comeback over the past few years, a comeback which has accelerated during the months since March. And if there is one thing which the events of the spring and summer taught us, it is that our police are not trained to handle these problems, so many of which are exacerbated by mental illness. It’s fair neither to the cops nor to their quality-of-life targets to make them solely responsible for managing this crisis. Before it became so politicized, the idea of shifting some funding from police departments to underwrite social workers or mental health professionals offering support and teamwork on some 911 calls made a lot of sense. It still does. </p>

                 <h1>Crowds</h1>
                 <p>Expect crowds and long lines anywhere you go. you anticipate this as a tourist, but as a local, its bear. Not only will you wait in line for food, but the streets are crowded all the time. it comes with the territory. </p>
