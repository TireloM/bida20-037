               <h3>outdoor ice-skating rinks open</h3>
               <p>New York City’s many ice-skating rinks are synonymous with winter and the first glimpse of the holiday season. If you prefer your skating experience to come with a killer view, go enjoy the spectacular surroundings of the seasonal Rink at Rockefeller Center (in December, the famous tree will be there, too). The Bank of America Winter Village at Bryant Park, which is typically open from late October to early March, is another fine option with stunning architecture nearby. </p>

               <h3>Shakespeare in the Park</h3>
                   <p>Shakespeare in the Park is a consummate New York City institution, one that has drawn more than 5 million people since it was first staged in Central Park’s Delacorte Theater in 1962. Theater lovers can see free outdoor productions of the Bard’s plays, usually starring well-known actors. (through August)</p>

               <h3>The Feast of San Gennaro</h3>
               <p> the event includes the best spots in Little Italy. Eat at some of the best Italian restaurants in the city, watch colorful parades, catch free concerts and of course, see the world-famous cannoli eating competition. Although the Feast of San Gennaro is a celebration of faith (folks tip their hats to the Patron Saint of Naples, Italy) the festive atmosphere, delicious food and colorful processions are what it’s known for. For 11 days, Little Italy is transformed into a red, white and green bash with special guests, live music and a cannoli eating contest.The Feast of San Gennaro is located along Mulberry Street between Canal and Houston Streets. The festival stage is located on the corner of Grand and Motts Sts and features live entertainment starting at 7:30pm each night.</p>
